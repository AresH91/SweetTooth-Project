# Sweet Tooth

As a full stack developer who loves desserts and preparing them, I wanted to align that passion with my project. 
That’s where Sweet Tooth Comes in. Sweet Tooth was designed to 
Offer a clean and easy to Navigate UI to help you find new dessert recipes, and even offer a random recipe when you’re 
feeling adventurous. You can even submit your recipe to our admins to be shared with our community! 




By utilizing React, Functional Components, and Bootstrap I was able to focus on each individual element and make sure I had a cohesive, clean, 
and interactive look throughout my project.  My goal was to avoid a static UI by utilizing simple CSS animations on events.	On the homepage we can
see dynamically populated Recipes using Mongoose to handle my MongoDB queries to display the most recently added recipes to the app.
At the moment there are several different ways to find recipes. You can find them by category, find the latest 5, viewing all recipes, 
and even using our search bar to find relative recipes. For individual ingredients we actually use a one to many relation or Nested Document 
in our DB Recipe Schema. Then populate this information using javascript mapping.
